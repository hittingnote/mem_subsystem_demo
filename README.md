## Memory Subsystem Demo

This repository provides a few demos to dive into the Linux memory subsystem. Through these demos, readers can figure out how `mmap()` is done inside the kernel (Demo 1), how to get the page list corresponding to the virtual memory region given by the user application (Demo 2), and how to construct the scatter-gather list of the user's virtual memory region which is later mapped to a DMA device.
